Find the keys to open the doors throughout the warehouse, and make your way through, piecing together the story as you go. Who knows, there may be a big twist at the end...</p>

      <p class="fs-6 text-right"> This game/experience was my final project for my VR Development class. In this course, we learned the basic fundamentals of Unity, how to create simple games and how to implement physics into the VR realm. For my final project, I wanted to take everything I learned and combine it into one experience. I learned how to implement smooth locomotion and turning, as well as teleportation in the VR engine. </p>

      <p class="fs-4 border-bottom border-1 pb-2 mt-3 text-left"> Fly in the Rain is a JavaScript-based game in which you are a fly... in the rain! You must survive for 15 seconds while multiple raindrops fall from the ceiling. If you get hit, you're out! On the main menu, it will count the amount of times you won during your current session. Can you beat my record of 13 wins?</p>

      <p class="fs-6 text-left"> This game was made as my unit 3 project for my Creative Coding class. In this class, we explored the fundamentals of JavaScript, and we use it for creative purposes! I built this by creating the canvas, which I wanted to match the layout of an iPhone, and then just adding the assets I needed for the game. The movement for the fly, and the raindrops are coded into the JavaScript file, which I learned how to do during my time in class. The music was also composed, mixed, and mastered by me. Overall, this project helped me learn more about how to use JavaScript for creative purposes.</p>

      <p class="fs-6"> This was a project I made for my Creative Coding class, in which I learned how to use JavaScript primitives to draw on a canvas. I also learned how to have different scenes using a switch statement, in which some slides pass by using a timer (which shows an indicator at the top left of the screen if that is the case), while others require you to click to move forward in the story. I learned a lot about JavaScript fundamentals and primitives, and I used them to create a story that I think was midly engaguing!</p>

    <p class="fs-6"> This music video was made for my Arts Technology Performance Studio class. In this class, we had 4 big projects throughout the semester, with this music video being the final project. It was a group project with 4 other people, in which we had to compose, record, mix and master a song, and then direct and edit a music video to go along with it. We had one member of our group come up with the main guitar riff and record it, which then I took that recording and composed and mixed a song based around it. We had the other memebers of our group record their own little licks to go along with the song, like the saxophone part in the chorus. Finally, after the song was fully finished, we sent it to another member of our group, who edited the video. The cool color effect comes from the RGB colors being assigned to different frequencies on the frequency spectrum. This makes it so when lower frequencies are played, the blues become brighter. Same thing with the reds and high frequencies, and greens with mid frequencies. I think this music video turned out great, and the song is groovy! </p>
