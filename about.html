    <p class="mt-4 text-center fs-3"><em> Hello, it's me! Colin Winkelmann! </em></p>

    <p class="mt-3 fs-6 mb-5 border-bottom border-white border-1 pb-3">Hello! I'm Colin Winkelmann, and I am a senior at Illinois State University. I am studying Creative Technologies , and I'm enjoying every minute of it! I focus on Audio Engineering. I was also accepted in to Graduate School to get my Masters of Science in Creative Technologies! Ever since I was young, I knew that my passion lied somewhere in the realm of Creative Technologies. Most of my free time was spent filming youtube videos (action-shorts) with my neighbor's help. The remainder of my free time was dedicated to composing songs on Garageband. My family would constantly hear me ask "Where's the family iPad?", just so I could migrate the ideas in my head to an actual audio workstation. Technology and creativity are the perfect marriage for me to express my creative ideas. </p>

    <p class="mt-2 fs-6">My favorite thing to do is compose, mix, and master music digitally. I use FL Studio to create rap beats, ambient pieces, and other electronic songs. During my sophomore year, I wrote the soundtrack (along with a few others) to a game, called Ground Zero, that was developed by the GameDev Club. The OST of the themes I wrote for Ground Zero is available to listen on the Audio page.  I also work on some experimental types of music, and I enjoy producing ambient style pieces. My CTK 345 Final Project is a piece in which I experimented with ambient digital as well as acoustic sounds. </p>
